The sheltering shade of the forest
Calling come in silence
Accompanied only by the full moon
Howling of a night wolf
And the path under my bare feet
The elvenpath

Hearing music from the deepest forest
Songs as a seduction of sirens
The elf-folk is calling me
Tapio, Bearking, Ruler of the forest
Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the ill and sad
Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path
